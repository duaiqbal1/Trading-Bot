SaaS-Based Trading Bot
A Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)-based trading system that automates trading strategies using MQL5 for MetaTrader 5 (MT5), integrated with Python for data fetching and signal generation, and a Flask-based web dashboard for remote management.

Overview
This project implements a trading bot (SimpleTradingBot) in MQL5 that executes trades on the EURUSD H1 timeframe based on signals generated by a Python backend. The system includes a web dashboard for monitoring bot performance, adjusting parameters, and viewing trade history. It was developed as part of an assignment to create a SaaS-based trading system with testing and documentation.

Key Features
MQL5 Trading Bot: Executes trades automatically on MT5 using signals from trade_signal.txt.
Python Integration: Fetches EURUSD price data via yfinance and generates trading signals.
Web Dashboard: Flask-based dashboard for monitoring (balance, profit, trades), adjusting parameters (lot size, stop loss, take profit), and viewing historical trades.

Testing: Backtested on historical data (2025-03-01 to 2025-03-21) using MT5â€™s Strategy Tester.
Documentation: Detailed report with explanations, screenshots, and test results.
